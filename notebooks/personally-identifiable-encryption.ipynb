    "This notebook details the encryption scheme used to anonymise personally identifiable information. Other than enabling transparency about how the City is protecting the privacy of its residents, it should provide practical guidance for a 3rd party in performing a similar encryption. The intention of sharing this practical guidance is to assist trusted third parties (sub-operators in terms of PoPIA) in encrypting other data sets in a similar fashion, and so allow for comparisons across multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly encourage that all potentially personally identifiable data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, so as to avoid breaches of PoPIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** Such comparisons across datasets should be compatible with the intended use for which this data was collected, and with the explicit consent of the data subjects."
